# Section Critic Protocol

Phase 8 delegation template for BLINDED section critics. Evaluate sections for unsupported claims, misrepresented evidence, and ignored counter-evidence.

**Information barrier:** This skill contains ONLY critique instructions. You do NOT receive the scaffold, argument arc, or the writing template that authors followed. You evaluate the section as-is against its evidence package. This blinding is intentional — if you knew the intended argument, you might excuse weaknesses that align with it.

## Phase 8: Section Critics

**Agent:** EXPERT_CRITICAL_LITERATURE_REVIE (parallel — one per 1–2 sections)

**Purpose:** Actor-critic separation for section prose. The Phase 7 agents optimized for narrative coherence. This phase checks whether the prose accurately represents the evidence. Like Phase 6, this uses the same agent type with different inputs and a different objective.

**Critic receives:**
- The section .tex file
- The section evidence package (including conflicts, evidence_gaps, unreplicated_claims)
- Paper abstracts for all papers cited in the section AND all papers in the evidence package (including uncited ones)

**Critic does NOT receive:**
- The scaffold or argument arc
- Other sections
- The section thesis or intended argument

**Conflict Survival Pre-Check (MANDATORY before launching Phase 8 critics):**

Before delegating to the blinded critic, the coordinator runs a mechanical pre-check on each section. This catches blatant conflict suppression cheaply, before spending critic agent tokens:

```python
import re

def conflict_precheck(section_tex, evidence_package):
    """Check that both DOIs from each conflict appear in the section .tex."""
    conflicts = evidence_package.get('conflicts', [])
    if not conflicts:
        return True, []
    
    missing = []
    for conflict in conflicts:
        doi_a = conflict['paper_a_doi']
        doi_b = conflict['paper_b_doi']
        # Map DOIs to cite_keys
        key_a = citation_key_map.get(doi_a, '')
        key_b = citation_key_map.get(doi_b, '')
        
        has_a = key_a and (key_a in section_tex)
        has_b = key_b and (key_b in section_tex)
        
        if not (has_a and has_b):
            missing.append({
                'conflict': conflict['nature_of_conflict'][:100],
                'paper_a': key_a or doi_a,
                'paper_b': key_b or doi_b,
                'a_cited': has_a,
                'b_cited': has_b,
            })
    
    survival_rate = 1 - (len(missing) / len(conflicts))
    return survival_rate >= 0.50, missing

# Run for each section before Phase 8
for sec_num, writer_id in section_to_writer_id.items():
    tex_content = open(f'section_{sec_num:02d}.tex').read()
    passed, missing = conflict_precheck(tex_content, section_packages[sec_num])
    
    if not passed:
        msg = (f"Conflict survival pre-check FAILED: {len(missing)} of "
               f"{len(section_packages[sec_num].get('conflicts', []))} "
               f"conflicts have missing citations. Add both sides:\n")
        for m in missing:
            msg += (f"\n- Conflict: {m['conflict']}\n"
                    f"  Paper A ({m['paper_a']}): {'cited' if m['a_cited'] else 'MISSING'}\n"
                    f"  Paper B ({m['paper_b']}): {'cited' if m['b_cited'] else 'MISSING'}\n")
        send_message(writer_id, msg)
        # Wait for revision before proceeding to Phase 8 for this section
```

**Delegation template:**

> "Read this section and its evidence package. Your job is to find claims in the text that are not supported by the evidence, and evidence in the package that the text misrepresents or ignores. Check six tracks:
>
> **TRACK 1 — Cross-Paper Compositional Claims:**
> Find every sentence that synthesizes, compares, or draws a conclusion across ≥2 papers.
> - Synthesis claims ('Studies A, B, C converge on X'): verify from abstracts that ALL cited papers support X. Flag if any cited paper contradicts or is irrelevant to the claim.
> - Progression claims ('X increased from [value in A] to [value in B]'): verify the values measure the same thing at the same scope and taxonomic level.
> - Contrast claims ('Unlike A, paper B found Y'): verify A actually found not-Y, not just something different.
> - Causal chains ('A established X, which B showed causes Y'): verify B actually builds on A's finding and the causal link is in the papers.
>
> **TRACK 2 — Single-Citation Deep Check:**
> Select the 20 most consequential claims in the section — topic sentences, paragraph conclusions, claims that other claims build on. For each:
> - Does the abstract support the SPECIFIC claim, not just the general topic?
> - Is the study system/scope/experimental context correct?
> - Is the confidence level appropriate? ('established' vs 'suggested' vs 'is consistent with')
> - Are quantitative values attributed correctly?
>
> **TRACK 3 — Conflict Survival:**
> The evidence package contains explicit conflicts. For each:
> - Does the section mention both sides?
> - If one side is omitted: flag.
> - If both sides are mentioned but the text presents a contested finding as resolved: flag.
> Also check: are unreplicated_claims presented with appropriate hedging? Are evidence_gaps acknowledged?
>
> **TRACK 4 — Scope Inflation:**
> Find claims that generalize beyond what the cited evidence supports:
> - Scope inflation: 'in [broad domain]' citing only [narrow subdomain] studies
> - System inflation: unqualified claims citing only one study system (species, material, dataset, etc.)
> - Condition inflation: general claims citing only one experimental condition or methodology
> - Type/category inflation: claims about a broad category citing only one specific subtype or variant
> - Temporal inflation: 'established' citing a single unreplicated study
>
> **TRACK 5 — Unused Counter-Evidence:**
> Compare the papers in the evidence package against the papers cited in the section. For the uncited papers:
> - Do any contradict claims made in the section?
> - Do any provide important nuance (different species, region, or result) that the section ignores?
> - Are any replication studies for claims presented as unreplicated?
> Most uncited papers will be confirmatory — only flag those that would change the section's conclusions if included.
>
> **TRACK 6 — Trace-to-Primary-Data (False Consensus Detection):**
> For each major mechanistic claim in the section (e.g., "X targets Y", "A drives B",
> "C mediates D"), ask: is there a paper in the evidence package that **experimentally
> measured** this specific mechanism, or is the claim repeated from reviews/textbooks
> without primary data?
> - Check: does the cited paper contain original experimental data (electrophysiology,
>   imaging, anatomy, etc.) demonstrating the claimed mechanism? Or is it itself a review
>   that repeats the claim without new data?
> - If ALL citations for a mechanistic claim are reviews or secondary sources: flag as
>   `SHOULD_CAVEAT` — "This claim is widely repeated but no primary experimental evidence
>   is cited. Either find the original paper or qualify: 'commonly described as... though
>   the primary experimental demonstration is [cite] / has recently been challenged [cite]'."
> - If the claim is uncited entirely: flag as `MUST_FIX` — "Uncited mechanistic claim.
>   This is the most dangerous failure mode: a 'textbook fact' that may reflect false
>   consensus rather than established evidence."
> - Specifically look for RECENT papers (last 2-3 years) that revise or contradict
>   long-standing mechanistic claims. These are high-value findings for the review.
>
> For each finding, return:
> ```json
> {
>   "track": 1-6,
>   "severity": "MUST_FIX | SHOULD_CAVEAT | MINOR",
>   "location": "subsection or line identifier",
>   "claim_text": "the problematic sentence(s)",
>   "cite_keys_involved": [],
>   "issue": "description of the problem",
>   "evidence": "what the abstracts/evidence package actually say",
>   "suggested_fix": "specific rewrite or caveat language"
> }
> ```
>
> Also return a summary:
> ```json
> {
>   "conflicts_in_package": N,
>   "conflicts_represented_in_text": M,
>   "conflicts_suppressed": N-M,
>   "suppressed_conflicts": [{"paper_a": "", "paper_b": "", "topic": ""}],
>   "papers_in_package": N,
>   "papers_cited": M,
>   "uncited_counter_evidence_count": K
> }
> ```
>
> **Calibration:** Be aggressive on Tracks 3 and 5. A section that presents a clean consensus when the evidence package contains conflicts is MORE problematic than a section with minor imprecisions. Conflict suppression is the most important failure mode to catch."

**Gate:**
- MUST_FIX findings block Phase 9. The section writer (the original Phase 7 actor) receives the findings via `send_message` and must revise. The fix is targeted: provide the specific sentences to change and why, not a request to rewrite the section.
- SHOULD_CAVEAT findings are collected and passed to Phase 10 integration for text amendments during the integration passes.
- MINOR findings are logged in the review metadata but do not block.
- **Conflict survival threshold:** If conflicts_represented / conflicts_in_package < 0.5, send back to the section writer: "More than half the conflicts in your evidence package are absent from the section. The following conflicts must be represented: [list]. Revise to include both sides of each."

**Interaction with Phase 15:** Phase 8 checks whether the text accurately represents the relationship between papers. Phase 15 checks whether the papers themselves are real and correctly identified. Both are needed — a claim can pass Phase 8 (synthesis is valid given the abstracts) and fail Phase 15 (one DOI is chimeric), or vice versa.

**ACTOR-CRITIC SEPARATION ENFORCEMENT:**

Phase 8 critics MUST be different child frames from Phase 7 section
writers. The coordinator verifies after launching:

```python
for critic_id in phase_4b_critic_ids:
    assert critic_id not in phase_4_writer_ids, \
        f'Critic {critic_id} is the same agent as a section writer — blinding violated'
```

**GATE ARTIFACT:** After all MUST_FIX issues are resolved (via `send_message` back to Phase 7 writers), save `gate_critic_complete.json`:

**MUST_FIX enforcement loop (coordinator executes):**
1. Collect MUST_FIX findings from all critic batches, group by section.
2. For each section with MUST_FIX: `send_message` to original Phase 7 writer with specific findings.
3. Wait for revision. Re-evaluate.
4. Repeat up to 3 iterations. Assert `total_must_fix == 0` before proceeding.

**Citation constraint during MUST_FIX revisions:**
**HARD RULE — Evidence Package Is the Only Source of Truth:**

Writers may ONLY cite papers from their per-section evidence package. Every cite_key they 
use MUST exist in the citation_key_map. There are NO exceptions.

- Writers MUST NOT generate, recall, or invent cite_keys from memory — ever.
- Writers MUST NOT "find more papers" when told a section is below the paper count floor.
- If a section's evidence package has too few papers to meet the floor, the writer reports 
  this back: "Section N has only M papers in the evidence package — below the floor of F."
- The COORDINATOR then runs a **supplementary Phase 2 search** to expand the evidence 
  package for that topic. The supplementary search follows the same Phase 2 protocol 
  (database queries, fulltext retrieval, DOI verification) and produces additional findings.
- The COORDINATOR then runs the new findings through Phase 3 (CrossRef validation) and 
  Phase 5 (curation into the section's evidence package) before sending them to the writer.
- Only AFTER the expanded evidence package is delivered does the writer revise the section.

The same rule applies during MUST_FIX revisions: if a critic says "add counter-evidence" 
or "cite both sides of this conflict" and the papers aren't in the evidence package, the 
writer reports the gap — the coordinator initiates a supplementary search, NOT the writer.

**Why this matters:** Every time a writer generates a citation from memory, it creates a 
hallucination vector. The citation_key_map exists precisely to prevent this. Keys in the map 
are mechanically derived from CrossRef metadata — no LLM involved. Keys from memory are 
unverifiable and frequently contaminated (the "Bhatt" failure mode).

After EACH MUST_FIX revision returns:
1. Extract all cite_keys from the revised .tex and .md files
2. Check every key against the citation_key_map
3. Any key not in the map → send back: "Key [X] not in citation_key_map. Remove it or 
   request a supplementary evidence search."
4. Run Bhatt contamination scan on the revision


**HARD BLOCK — Execute before any Phase 9 delegation:**

**HARD BLOCK:** `assert total_must_fix == 0` before any Phase 9 delegation.

**MANDATORY — Bibliography rebuild trigger:**
If the Phase 8 MUST_FIX loop produced ANY text revisions, Phase 9 MUST re-extract cite_keys 
from ALL section files (not just the original set). The MUST_FIX process may have added new 
citations that need .bib entries.

Gate check before Phase 10: assert orphaned_keys == 0 (cited in .tex/.md but not in .bib).
