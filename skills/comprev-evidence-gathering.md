# Evidence Gathering Protocol

Phase 2 delegation template for evidence-gathering agents. Each agent searches databases and returns structured evidence for one topic cluster.

**Evidence Parameters:** The coordinator's delegation task includes an `evidence_parameters` block (defined in the orchestrator skill, Phase 1). Read it to determine:
- `min_papers_per_cluster` — minimum unique papers to return (default 70)
- `saturation_criterion` — optional stopping rule (e.g., "<2% new unique in last 100")
- `snowball_rounds` — how many citation-chasing rounds to run (default 0)
- `total_bibliography_target` — optional total across all clusters

If `evidence_parameters` is absent from the delegation task, use defaults (70 papers, no saturation, no snowball).

**Information barrier:** This skill contains ONLY evidence-gathering instructions. You cannot see how sections are written (Phase 7), how they are critiqued (Phase 8), or how figures are audited (Phase 6). This is intentional.

## Phase 2: Evidence Gathering

**Agent:** LITREVIEW (parallel — one per topic cluster) 

**Database selection:** The specific literature databases depend on the review's domain. This skill references PubMed, Europe PMC, bioRxiv, and medRxiv as examples because its initial deployment was in biomedical sciences. For other domains, substitute the appropriate databases:
- **Biomedical / life sciences:** PubMed, Europe PMC, bioRxiv, medRxiv
- **Physics / astronomy:** NASA ADS, INSPIRE-HEP, arXiv
- **Computer science:** DBLP, Semantic Scholar, arXiv
- **Social sciences / economics:** SSRN, RePEc, EconLit
- **General / multidisciplinary:** OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, CrossRef, Google Scholar

CrossRef is domain-neutral and should always be included for DOI resolution. The principles below (DOI verification, full-text retrieval, database-first metadata) apply regardless of which databases are used. Where the text says "PubMed or Europe PMC," read it as "the appropriate domain database."

Each agent searches databases and returns structured evidence. Delegation MUST request this output schema:

```json

  "findings": [{"claim": "", "claim_source_sentence": "verbatim sentence from abstract (if text_access=abstract_only) or paper body (if text_access=fulltext)", "evidence": "", "effect_size": "", "effect_size_source_sentence": "verbatim sentence containing the number, or null if qualitative only", "n": 0, "study_system": "what was studied: e.g. species, material, model organism, dataset, language, market — domain-dependent", "replication_status": "", "replication_evidence_dois": ["doi1", "doi2"], "doi": "", "text_access": "fulltext | abstract_only"}],

    }
  ]
}
```

**MANDATORY — Coordinator delegation discipline:**
The coordinator writes the Phase 2 delegation task descriptions. These contain topic descriptions and search guidance for each cluster. The following rules apply to the coordinator when writing these delegations:

- Describe TOPICS to search for, not specific "Author & Author Year" references. Write "search for papers on [topic X properties], [mechanism Y], and [pathway Z function]" — NOT "find Armstrong & Bhatt 2012, Varga et al 2010."
- If you want to suggest a landmark paper, describe it by its finding: "the landmark paper establishing [key finding X]" — not by author names recalled from memory.
- NEVER generate author names, co-author names, or years from LLM memory for inclusion in a delegation. These are the primary vector for Bhatt-type contamination, where the LLM substitutes a high-frequency author name for the correct but less-frequent co-author.
- The evidence agents have database access. Trust them to discover the actual papers. Your role is to define what topics to cover and what questions to answer, not to pre-populate the reference list.
- **No author names in output:** Do NOT include author names, cite_keys, or "Author Year" labels anywhere in your output. Use DOIs as the sole paper identifier. The coordinator will derive cite_keys mechanically from database metadata. This eliminates the possibility of author-name contamination. If you need to refer to a paper in your reasoning, use the DOI or a descriptive phrase ("the 2023 whole-brain atlas paper") — never "Bhatt et al." or any author name from memory.

**Citation discipline:**
- Every paper MUST have a DOI verified against a database (PubMed, Europe PMC, or CrossRef) — not recalled from LLM memory.
- Every finding entry must include the DOI. If a DOI cannot be found, flag with `DOI-NOT-FOUND` and include enough metadata (title, authors, journal, year) for later resolution.
- Do NOT fabricate bibliographic metadata. If uncertain about a detail, search for it rather than guessing.
- **Hard drop rule for failed searches:** If a database search for a paper returns zero results, the paper MUST be excluded from the evidence output. Do not fill in metadata from memory. Do not include a paper just because the coordinator's task description mentioned it. The coordinator's suggested topics are search guidance, not a source of truth — if a paper cannot be found in PubMed, Europe PMC, or CrossRef, it may not exist. Mark it in a `search_failures` list (paper description, search queries tried, zero-result confirmation) but do NOT include it in `findings` or assign it a DOI.
- **Schema-only requirement:** Findings must contain ONLY the schema fields: `claim`, `claim_source_sentence`, `effect_size`, `effect_size_source_sentence`, `n`, `species`, `replication_status`, `replication_evidence_dois`, `doi`, `text_access`. If a cluster returns findings with additional fields (`title`, `authors`, `journal`, `year`, `pmid`, `volume`, `pages`, `cite_key`), send back: "Remove non-schema fields. Each extra free-text field is a fabrication vector — measured 74% hallucination rate when agents add an authors field. Cite_keys are assigned mechanically by the coordinator, not by agents."
- **Full-text retrieval requirement:** Every paper must have `text_access` set to `fulltext`, `abstract_only`, or `metadata_only`, reflecting a genuine retrieval attempt.

**Full-Text Retrieval Protocol :**

Agents MUST use `retrieve_fulltext()` for ALL papers — not just the "top 50." The function tries publisher APIs first (which have higher success rates for paywalled content), then falls back to open-access sources.

The retrieval protocol (API tiers, size validation) is defined in the comprev-reviewer-agent skill.

**Size-based validation (MANDATORY after any retrieval):**
- Response > 15KB AND contains `<body>` tag → genuine fulltext → `text_access = "fulltext"`
- Response > 15KB but no `<body>` tag → inspect manually; may be metadata-heavy XML
- Response < 15KB → metadata-only or abstract-only → `text_access = "abstract_only"` regardless of HTTP status code
- PMC frequently returns HTTP 200 with a valid XML envelope containing only the abstract. The size check catches this (Failure Mode #23).

**Fulltext extraction rule (MANDATORY):**
When fulltext is genuinely retrieved (>15KB with `<body>` tag), the `claim_source_sentence` MUST come from the paper body — NOT from the abstract. Extract findings from the Results, Discussion, or other body sections. If you can only find a relevant sentence in the abstract, set `text_access = "abstract_only"` even if you have the fulltext available. The `text_access` field indicates where the SOURCE SENTENCE came from, not whether you had access to the paper.

This means:
- `text_access = "fulltext"` → source sentence is from the paper body, not findable in the abstract
- `text_access = "abstract_only"` → source sentence is from the abstract

The validator will check this: if `text_access = "fulltext"` but the source sentence IS found in the abstract, the finding fails validation. Extract deeper or label honestly.

**Coordinator full-text fallback tiers** remain as before, but agents now use `retrieve_fulltext()` instead of `fetch_article_fulltext` for their initial retrieval pass. Call with explicit keys:

```python
text, source = retrieve_fulltext(
    doi,
    elsevier_api_key=os.environ.get('ELSEVIER_API_KEY'),
    springer_api_key=os.environ.get('SPRINGER_API_KEY'),
    ncbi_api_key=os.environ.get('NCBI_API_KEY'),
)
```
- **Text-only extraction requirement:** All `claim`, `effect_size`, and `figure_data.papers.value` fields must come from retrieved text. Every value must have a corresponding `_source_sentence`. Papers with `text_access` = `metadata_only` must be excluded from findings entirely and moved to `search_failures` — they cannot contribute claims, source sentences, or quantitative data.
- **Figure data requirement:** Every `figure_data.papers.value` must have a non-null `value_source_sentence`. Papers without a traceable number are excluded from figure comparisons.
- **Replication evidence requirement:** `replication_status` = `independently_replicated` requires ≥2 DOIs from different labs in `replication_evidence_dois`. `contested` requires conflicting DOIs. Otherwise use `replication_unknown`.

**Coordinator enforcement obligation:** These are gates, not advisories. Send back non-compliant clusters via `send_message`.

**Source sentence self-validation (MANDATORY before final save):**

After extracting all findings and before saving the evidence JSON, run this validation on EVERY finding:

1. For each finding, retrieve the paper's abstract from Europe PMC using the DOI:
   ```
   https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/webservices/rest/search?query=DOI:{doi}&format=json&resultType=core
   ```
2. Check whether `claim_source_sentence` is a verbatim substring of the retrieved abstract text. Use the FULL sentence for matching — not the first 30-50 characters.
3. For findings with `text_access = "fulltext"`, the source sentence may come from the paper body rather than the abstract. These pass validation IF the fulltext was genuinely retrieved (>15KB with `<body>` tag).
4. For ANY finding where the source sentence is NOT found in the abstract AND no genuine fulltext was retrieved: **re-extract the finding from the actual abstract text.** Read the abstract, find the most relevant sentence, and copy it verbatim.
5. Report validation results in the structured output:
   - `total_checked`: number of findings validated
   - `source_in_abstract`: exact substring match in abstract
   - `source_in_fulltext`: source from fulltext body (fulltext verified >15KB)
   - `source_not_found`: not found in any retrieved text (these are protocol violations)
   - `re_extracted`: findings that were re-extracted after failing validation

**What counts as a violation:**
- Paper title used as `claim_source_sentence` (titles are not findings)
- Paraphrased sentence that doesn't appear verbatim in the abstract
- Source sentence manufactured from memory without retrieval
- `text_access = "fulltext"` when no >15KB document was retrieved for this DOI

**Anti-gaming rule:** The validation must use the FULL `claim_source_sentence` as the search string, not a truncated prefix. Matching on the first 30-50 characters is insufficient — it passes paraphrases that diverge after the opening words. Use `source_sentence in abstract_text` (full string containment), not `source_sentence[:50] in abstract_text`.

The coordinator will independently re-run this validation on a random sample after receiving the evidence. Discrepancies between the agent's self-reported numbers and the coordinator's verification will trigger a full re-validation and send-back.

**Compliance checklist (each returning cluster):**
- [ ] `conflicts` non-empty? If empty → send back.
- [ ] `weakest_evidence_cited` substantive? If "all strong" → send back.
- [ ] `figure_data` present? If empty → send back.
- [ ] `papers_reviewed_count` ≥ `min_papers_per_cluster` (from `evidence_parameters` in the delegation task)? If below → send back with specific undertreated subtopics.
- [ ] Cross-cluster unique DOI count ≥ 80% of target? If below → send back thinnest clusters for additional citation chaining.
- [ ] Every paper has a DOI (starts with `10.`)? If not → send back.
- [ ] `search_failures` present for papers mentioned in delegation but not found in databases? If unfound papers appear in `findings` without database-verified DOI → send back.
- [ ] Fulltext retrieval rate ≥ 20% per cluster? If below → send back (worker likely skipped retrieval).
- [ ] Overall fulltext rate ≥ 50% across all clusters after fallback tiers? If below → delegate targeted retrieval to LITREVIEW agent via send_message.
- [ ] Quantitative extraction: ≥ 30% of findings have non-null `effect_size`? If below → send back for number extraction.
- [ ] Sample size: ≥ 20% of findings have `n` > 0? If below → send back.
- [ ] Replication status: ≤ 70% `replication_unknown`? If above → send back for replication investigation.
- [ ] Every `independently_replicated` finding has ≥2 DOIs in `replication_evidence_dois`? If not → send back.
- [ ] Every conflict has valid DOIs for both papers + non-empty `conflict_source` (≥20 chars)? If not → send back.
- [ ] `figure_data` comparisons have `homogeneity_check` with non-trivial `caveats` when uniformity fields are false? If not → send back.
- [ ] No `metadata_only` papers in findings? If present → send back.
- [ ] Schema field names exactly match the orchestrator schema? 
  Conflicts MUST have: paper_a_doi, paper_b_doi, nature_of_conflict, likely_reason, conflict_source
  Figure_data MUST have: comparison_id, comparison_name, what_it_reveals, suggested_plot_type, 
  papers, homogeneity_check
  If an agent returns 'topic' instead of 'nature_of_conflict', or 'title' instead of 
  'comparison_name' → send back: "Field names must match the schema exactly. 
  Rename [wrong_field] to [correct_field]."
- [ ] **Contradiction search executed?** For each major topic, at least one query must 
  explicitly search for papers that challenge or revise the textbook narrative. Include queries
  like "[mechanism X] challenged OR revised OR incorrect OR reconsidered" and 
  "[established claim] alternative OR reinterpretation". If zero contradiction-targeted queries
  were run → send back: "Add explicit searches for papers that challenge the consensus on [topic]."
- [ ] **False consensus risks identified?** The `evidence_gaps` array must include at least one
  entry with a claim that is "widely stated but primary experimental evidence is thin or absent."
  If the agent reports zero false-consensus risks across an entire topic cluster → this is itself
  suspicious. Send back: "Identify at least one claim in this topic area where the textbook 
  narrative may outpace the primary experimental evidence."



- **DOI-title cross-validation (MANDATORY, not a sample):** After each cluster returns, the coordinator verifies EVERY DOI by fetching its title from CrossRef and comparing against the reported title in the evidence package. Implementation:
  - For each paper in findings:
    - `GET https://api.crossref.org/works/{doi}`
    - Extract title from response
    - Compare word overlap between CrossRef title and the finding's `claim_source_sentence` (first 10 words of each)
    - If overlap < 0.2 and no shared domain-specific terms: flag as `WRONG_DOI`
  - If >10% of a cluster's DOIs are flagged:
    - Send back: "DOIs point to the wrong papers. Rebuild using search-first: iterate over database search results and extract DOIs with `result.get('doi')`. Do not pre-populate paper lists from memory."
  - For individual flagged DOIs:
    - Search Europe PMC by the REPORTED title
    - If found: replace with the correct DOI
    - If not found: move to `search_failures`
  - Papers with `text_access` = `metadata_only` must NOT appear in findings. If present → send back: "Remove metadata-only papers from findings. Papers without at least an abstract cannot contribute evidence."
- `replication_evidence_dois` populated for every `independently_replicated` finding? If not → send back.
- **Figure data comparability check:** For each `figure_data` comparison, verify the `homogeneity_check` is present and non-trivial. If `scope_region_uniform`, `scope_population_uniform`, or `taxonomic_level_uniform` is false, verify that `caveats` is non-empty and describes the heterogeneity. If all three are marked true but the `metric` fields across entries differ substantively (e.g., "Number of category-X types" vs "Number of clusters (whole dataset)"), send back: "The metric labels in comparison [comparison_id] differ but homogeneity_check claims uniformity. Re-examine whether these entries are measuring the same thing at the same scope."
- **Quantitative extraction rate:** At least 30% of findings must have a
  non-empty, non-null `effect_size` field (excluding values like "not
  reported", "N/A", "qualitative"). If below 30% → send back: "Only X%
  of findings have effect sizes. For the top 50 papers by relevance,
  return to the abstract or full text and extract any reported numbers:
  percentages, fold-changes, p-values, correlation coefficients, response
  magnitudes. Set effect_size_source_sentence to the verbatim sentence
  containing each number."
- **Sample size extraction rate:** At least 20% of findings must have
  `n` as an integer > 0. If below 20% → send back: "Only X% of findings
  report sample size. For each finding, check the abstract for n, number
  of cells, number of animals, number of slices, number of recordings.
  Use the most relevant n for the claim (e.g., neurons recorded, not
  total animals, if the claim is about neural activity)."
- **Replication status audit:** No more than 70% of findings may have
  `replication_status` = `replication_unknown`. If above 70% → send back:
  "X% of findings have unknown replication status. For the top 50 claims,
  actively investigate: search PubMed for [claim keywords] AND (replicate
  OR confirm OR consistent OR corroborate). For each, upgrade to
  `independently_replicated` (with ≥2 DOIs from different labs in
  `replication_evidence_dois`), `contested` (with conflicting DOIs), or
  confirm `replication_unknown` with a one-sentence note explaining why
  no replication evidence was found."
- **Conflict DOI completeness:** Every entry in `conflicts` must have
  valid DOIs for both papers (fields: `paper_a_doi` and `paper_b_doi`).
  Descriptions like "the 2012 gain control papers" are not sufficient —
  resolve them to DOIs. If any conflict lacks both DOIs → send back:
  "Resolve conflict paper descriptions to database-verified DOIs."
- **Conflict source completeness:** Every entry in `conflicts` must have
  a non-empty `conflict_source` field (≥20 characters) describing which
  sentences in which papers' abstracts or full text establish the conflict.
  If empty → send back: "Fill conflict_source with the specific sentences
  from each paper's text that demonstrate the disagreement."

**DOI-title cross-validation (MANDATORY — delegated to DATAML in Phase 3):**
For each DOI, DATAML compares CrossRef title word overlap with claim_source_sentence. Overlap < 0.2 → flag as WRONG_DOI. >10% flag rate per cluster → send cluster back for rebuild. Individual flags → search by reported title for correct DOI.


## Snowball Protocol

When `evidence_parameters.snowball_rounds` ≥ 1 (passed in the delegation task), execute citation chasing AFTER the initial keyword search pass:

**Per round:**
1. **Rank** the current result set by citation count (OpenAlex `cited_by_count`).
2. **Select** the top 50 most-cited papers (or all papers if fewer than 50).
3. **Backward snowball:** For each selected paper, retrieve its reference list via OpenAlex (`referenced_works`). Add any DOI not already in the result set.
4. **Forward snowball:** For each selected paper, retrieve its cited-by list via OpenAlex (`cited_by` endpoint, paginated). Add any DOI not already in the result set.
5. **Screen** newly added DOIs by title/abstract against the cluster's inclusion criteria. Remove irrelevant additions.
6. **Log** the round: `{"round": N, "seed_papers": 50, "backward_added": X, "forward_added": Y, "after_screen": Z, "cumulative_unique": W}`.

Repeat for `snowball_rounds` iterations. Each round uses the expanded set (including previous round's additions) as the seed, so citation chains propagate.

**Important:** Snowball rounds will surface papers that don't contain the original search keywords but are cited by / cite papers that do. This is the primary mechanism for escaping keyword-search blind spots. Do NOT filter snowball additions by keyword match — screen them by topical relevance to the cluster.


## Saturation Protocol

When `evidence_parameters.saturation_criterion` is set (e.g., `"<2% new unique in last 100"`), the agent must track per-pass yield and stop only when the criterion fires:

**Tracking:**
After each search pass (initial keyword search, each snowball round, each query expansion), record:
```json
{
  "pass_type": "keyword | snowball_round_N | expansion_N",
  "query_or_method": "the search string or 'forward snowball on top-50'",
  "records_examined": 100,
  "new_unique_relevant": 3,
  "new_unique_rate": 0.03,
  "cumulative_unique": 287,
  "cumulative_screened_in": 245
}
```

**Stopping rule:**
- Parse the criterion string. Example: `"<2% new unique in last 100"` means: in the most recent pass of 100 records, fewer than 2% were new unique relevant papers not already in the result set.
- The criterion must fire in **two consecutive passes** to trigger a stop. A single low-yield pass could be a database-specific gap, not true saturation.
- `min_papers_per_cluster` (if set) acts as a hard floor: even if the saturation criterion fires early, do not stop until the floor is met.

**Output:**
Save `saturation_log.json` as an artifact alongside the evidence package. This log is consumed by the validator (check `EVIDENCE_PARAMETERS_HONORED`) and by the Methods section (Phase 13) to document the search strategy.


## Evidence Schema

Every evidence-gathering agent returns a JSON matching this schema. The coordinator validates compliance on return.

```json
{
  "findings": [{"claim": "", "claim_source_sentence": "verbatim sentence from abstract (if text_access=abstract_only) or paper body (if text_access=fulltext)", "evidence": "", "effect_size": "", "effect_size_source_sentence": "verbatim sentence containing the number, or null if qualitative only", "n": 0, "study_system": "what was studied: e.g. species, material, model organism, dataset, language, market — domain-dependent", "replication_status": "", "replication_evidence_dois": ["doi1", "doi2"], "doi": "", "text_access": "fulltext | abstract_only"}],

      ],
      "comparison_type": "cross-study conflict | convergent evidence | dose-response | timeline",
      "what_it_reveals": "Why this comparison matters",

      "searches_tried": ["query1", "query2"],
      "result": "zero results in PubMed and Europe PMC",
      "action": "excluded from evidence"
    }
```


**MANDATORY — Evidence JSON compliance:**
- Conflicts MUST use exactly these fields: `paper_a_doi`, `paper_b_doi`, `paper_a_claim`, `paper_b_claim`, `nature_of_conflict`, `resolution_status`. No other field names. No nested objects for sides. No `papers[]` arrays. No custom field names per conflict type. Every conflict MUST have both DOIs.
- JSON values: use `null` for missing values, NEVER the Python string `"None"`. Agents must ensure None→null conversion during JSON serialization.
- `figure_data` papers arrays MUST have unique DOIs. Deduplicate before saving. If the same paper appears multiple times in a comparison, keep only the first entry.

# Working Procedures (from comprev-reviewer-agent)

## Part III: How to Work

### Coverage and Search
- ≥ `min_papers_per_cluster` papers per major topic (from `evidence_parameters`). If `total_bibliography_target` is set, redistribute effort across clusters to meet it. If `saturation_criterion` is set, continue searching until the criterion fires (see Saturation Protocol below)
- Seed papers → citation chains (3 iterations) → systematic database search
- ≥6 distinct targeted queries per topic across domain-appropriate databases (e.g., PubMed, bioRxiv, Europe PMC, OpenAlex for biomedical; ADS, arXiv for physics; DBLP, Semantic Scholar for CS)
- Search must extend beyond landmark papers to include: replication studies, negative results, methodological variants, cross-domain extensions, and cross-system comparison studies
- For each topic, after initial search, identify which subtopics have <10 papers and run dedicated follow-up queries for those gaps

### DOI Provenance: Search-First, Never Memory-First

DOIs are opaque identifiers. LLMs do not reliably know the mapping
between paper titles and DOI strings. A DOI that looks correct (right
journal prefix, plausible format) frequently points to a different paper.

**The ONLY permitted workflow for adding a paper to findings:**
1. Run a database search query (using domain-appropriate databases — e.g., Europe PMC, PubMed, OpenAlex, bioRxiv for biomedical)
2. Parse the results returned by the API
3. Extract the DOI from the result object: `doi = result.get("doi")`
4. Use this DOI for all subsequent steps (article_getter, fulltext retrieval)

**PROHIBITED patterns:**
```python
# ❌ NEVER pre-populate paper lists from memory
key_papers_to_verify = [
    {"doi": "10.1038/s41586-019-1506-7", "title": "..."},
]

# ❌ NEVER create landmark/seed paper dicts with hardcoded DOIs
landmark_verified = {
    "10.xxxx/some-recalled-doi": {"title": "..."},
}

# ❌ NEVER type a DOI as a string literal in add_finding()
add_finding("10.1038/nn.1199", title="...", ...)

# ❌ NEVER create master_papers / core_papers / seed_papers dicts
landmark_dois = {"10.xxxx/some-recalled-doi": "Author et al 20XX - Famous Result"}
```

**REQUIRED pattern:**
```python
# ✅ ALWAYS extract DOIs by iterating over search results
for r in data.get('resultList', {}).get('result', []):
    doi = r.get('doi')  # DOI comes FROM the API
    if doi:
        title = r.get('title', '')
        papers.append({'doi': doi, 'title': title, ...})
```

If you know a paper should be included but it didn't appear in search results: Do NOT hardcode its DOI. Instead:
- Run a NEW search query using the paper's title as the search string
- Use the DOI returned by that title search
- If the title search returns zero results, put it in `search_failures`

LLMs recall paper titles accurately but DOI strings inaccurately. The title is usually right; the DOI is often wrong. By searching for the title, you get the correct DOI from the database instead of fabricating one from memory.

### Paper Verification
- Every cited paper MUST have a verified DOI
- Search databases to confirm: title, authors, journal, year, DOI
- When using PubMed: use esummary (JSON), not efetch (XML) — JSON parses reliably; XML silently drops fields
- Never cite from LLM memory alone — always verify against a database
- If a paper cannot be found in any database, flag it explicitly
- Citation keys MUST be ASCII-only. Replace accented characters with their ASCII equivalents (ø→o, ö→o, ü→u, é→e, ñ→n, ç→c, å→a, etc.). Example: Lensjø2017 → Lensjo2017. Non-ASCII keys cause LaTeX compilation failures.


### Consensus Challenge Search (Mandatory)

For every major consensus claim you encounter during evidence gathering, ask:
**"Which paper first demonstrated this experimentally?"**

- If you find the primary experimental source → include it in findings with a note
- If you CANNOT find the primary source (only reviews repeating the claim) → log it as an
  `evidence_gap` with type: `false_consensus_risk`:
  ```json
  {
    "topic": "the specific mechanistic claim",
    "what_is_missing": "Primary experimental demonstration — claim is repeated across reviews but original data source not identified",
    "why_it_matters": "Risk of false consensus: widely stated claim without traceable experimental evidence"
  }
  ```

Additionally, for each major topic, run at least one **contradiction search**:
- "[established mechanism] challenged OR revised OR reconsidered"
- "[textbook claim] incorrect OR alternative OR reinterpreted"
- "[mechanism] new evidence against OR contradicts"

Recent papers (last 2-3 years) that revise long-standing claims are among the most
valuable findings for a critical review. Prioritize them.

### Evidence Gathering Output
When gathering evidence (Phase 2 of orchestrator), produce STRUCTURED output — not prose. Return findings, conflicts, unreplicated claims, evidence gaps, strongest/weakest evidence, and figure_data as specified by the orchestrator's schema.

**For every paper you include, follow this procedure:**

1. **Retrieve metadata and text.** Call `article_getter` with the DOI. Do not store title, authors, journal, volume, or pages — those fields do not exist in your output schema. Do NOT generate cite_keys — the coordinator assigns them mechanically from database metadata after evidence gathering. If `article_getter` returns abstract but no full text, try these additional sources before giving up:
   - If the paper has a PMCID: call `bc_get_europepmc_fulltext` for full-text XML.
   - Search domain-appropriate full-text sources by DOI (e.g., `bc_get_europepmc_articles` for biomedical — check for `fullTextUrlList` for open-access URLs). If a URL is returned, fetch it.
   - For preprints: use the appropriate reader — `read_biorxiv_paper`, `read_medrxiv_paper`, or `read_arxiv_paper` as applicable to the domain.
   - For your top 50 papers by relevance, also call `fetch_article_fulltext(doi)` and update `text_access` to `fulltext` if successful.

   Set `text_access` to `fulltext`, `abstract_only`, or `metadata_only` based on what you obtained.

   After retrieving metadata, COMPARE the returned title against the title from the search result that provided this DOI:
   ```python
   search_title_words = set(search_result_title.lower().split()[:10])
   retrieved_title_words = set(retrieved_title.lower().split()[:10])
   overlap = len(search_title_words & retrieved_title_words) / max(len(search_title_words), len(retrieved_title_words))

   if overlap < 0.3:
       # DOI POINTS TO WRONG PAPER — do not use this DOI
       # Search by title instead to find the correct DOI
   ```
   This catches DOIs that resolve but point to a different paper.

   **After retrieval, call `add_finding()` using ONLY these fields:**
   ```python
   add_finding(
       doi=doi,                          # from search result
       claim=claim,                      # paraphrased from retrieved text
       claim_source_sentence=verbatim,   # copied from retrieved text
       effect_size=effect_size,           # from retrieved text, or null
       effect_size_source_sentence=src,   # verbatim sentence, or null
       n=n,                              # from retrieved text, or null
       study_system=study_system,        # from retrieved text
       text_access=text_access,          # fulltext | abstract_only
       replication_status="replication_unknown",
       # ↑ Default — but do NOT accept blindly. Before finalizing each finding:
       #   • Search for the same result from a different lab → "independently_replicated" (list DOIs)
       #   • Search for contradicting results → "contested" (list DOIs)
       #   • Only keep "replication_unknown" after active search found nothing
       replication_evidence_dois=[],
   )
   ```
   There is no `title` parameter. There is no `authors` parameter. There is no `cite_key` parameter (the coordinator assigns cite_keys mechanically from database metadata). There is no `journal`, `volume`, or `pages` parameter. If you find yourself typing any of those field names, you are inventing schema fields that do not exist — stop.

**Fulltext sourcing requirement:** If `text_access` is `fulltext`, the `claim_source_sentence` MUST come from the BODY of the paper (results, methods, or discussion section) — NOT the abstract. Abstract-sourced sentences for fulltext papers are a compliance failure. Include the paper section identifier (e.g., "Results, paragraph 3" or "Discussion") as a prefix to the source sentence.


2. **Extract findings from the retrieved text.** Read what you retrieved. Identify sentences describing the paper's main results. Paraphrase them as the `claim`. Copy the verbatim sentence(s) into `claim_source_sentence`. Do not describe findings from LLM memory — describe what the text says.

"When text_access is fulltext, extract claims from the Results and Methods sections — not just the abstract. Full text contains effect sizes with confidence intervals, exact sample sizes per condition, control comparisons, and methodological caveats that abstracts omit. These are the measurements that distinguish a landmark finding entry from a confirmatory one. When text_access is abstract_only, extract what the abstract provides but note the lower resolution."

3. **Extract numbers from the retrieved text.** Numbers are
   measurements. They come from your instrument (the text), not memory.

   a. Search for sentences containing digits, percentages,
      fold-changes, or units.
   b. When you find a number: copy the ENTIRE sentence into
      `value_source_sentence`. This is your raw data.
   c. When the text describes a result without a number:
      set `effect_size` to the qualitative description. This is a
      valid observation at lower resolution.
   d. When you cannot find the result: set `effect_size` to null.
      This is a null measurement — record it, do not fill it.
   e. For `figure_data`: ONLY include papers where you found the
      number in the text with a source sentence.

4. **Papers without text access.** Papers with `text_access` = `metadata_only` (no abstract, no full text) MUST be excluded from findings entirely. Move them to `search_failures` with `action` = "metadata_only — no text available for evidence extraction." Papers without even an abstract cannot contribute claims, source sentences, or quantitative data.

5. **Replication status.** To mark a finding as `independently_replicated`, you must have found ≥2 papers from different labs (different last authors) reporting the same result. List their DOIs in `replication_evidence_dois`. For `contested`, list the conflicting DOIs. If you cannot identify specific replicating or conflicting papers from your searches, use `replication_unknown`.

6. **Before saving, verify your count.** `len(set(f['doi'] for f in findings))` must be ≥ `min_papers_per_cluster` per section covered (read this value from the `evidence_parameters` in your delegation task; default 70). If below target, you are over-filtering — go back and include replication studies, negative results, and cross-area extensions.

7. **Before saving, verify extraction rates.** The orchestrator will reject clusters that fall below these thresholds:
   - **Effect size rate:** ≥30% of findings must have a non-empty, non-null `effect_size` (excluding "not reported", "N/A", "qualitative"). If below 30%, return to abstracts/full text for your top 50 papers and extract any reported numbers.
   - **Sample size rate:** ≥20% of findings must have `n` as an integer > 0. Check abstracts for cell counts, animal counts, recording counts.
   - **Replication status rate:** ≤70% of findings may have `replication_status` = `replication_unknown`. For your top 50 claims, actively search for replication or contradiction evidence before accepting "unknown."

**figure_data is mandatory:** For each major conflict or convergence, extract quantitative values from each paper's text. Every `figure_data.papers.value` must have a `value_source_sentence`. If the number isn't in the text, exclude that paper from the comparison.

**Comparability fields:** For each figure_data comparison, also record:
- `scope_region`: the anatomical/geographic scope of the measurement
- `scope_population`: what entity population was measured
- `taxonomic_level`: the classification granularity of any count
- `n_definition`: what n counts (e.g., samples collected vs samples post-QC)
- `n_analyzed`: the post-QC or actually-analyzed count, if different from n

After assembling all entries in a comparison, record a `homogeneity_check`: are all entries comparable in scope_region, scope_population, taxonomic_level, and n_definition? List any caveats. This metadata is used by the comparability audit (Phase 6) to catch misleading cross-study figures.

### Citation Density
Before saving any .tex file, count your `\citep{}`/`\citet{}` commands and divide by the number of substantial paragraphs (exclude figure environments, single-sentence transitions, and subsection-opening topic sentences followed by elaboration). Report this as `citations_per_paragraph` in your structured output. If below 4.0, restructure: merge consecutive single-paper paragraphs into synthesis paragraphs that cite 5–8 papers in dialogue before each paragraph's concluding synthesis sentence.

### Synthesis Structure
Organize by **debates and open questions**, not just topics. Each section: historical context, strongest evidence, contradictions, limitations, critical assessment.

**Integration density targets:**
- Each synthesis paragraph should cite 5–8 papers in dialogue, not cover them sequentially.
- Structure: "Claim sentence citing \citep{A, B}. \citet{A} established X under condition C1. \citet{B} extended this to C2 but found a discrepancy in Z. \citet{C} and \citet{D} resolved this by showing condition-dependence \citep{C, D}. Confirmatory evidence spans three additional preparations \citep{E, F, G}. Together, these studies establish [synthesis], though [remaining gap]."
- Reserve sequential paper-by-paper exposition for historical narratives where chronology IS the argument.
