# Integration and Bookend Protocol

Phase 10 (six-pass integration across all sections) and Phase 11 (Introduction, Conclusion, and Abstract). The integration role sees the full document structure — this is intentional, as integration requires cross-section awareness.

**Information barrier:** No information barrier. The integrator needs full document visibility to ensure consistency, transitions, and cross-references.

---

## Phase 10: Integration

**Agent:** EXPERT_CRITICAL_LITERATURE_REVIE

**PREREQUISITE:**
```python
require_phase('5_bibliography')
check_gate('gate_bibliography.json')
```

Single agent reads all sections, performs:

**Citation discipline for ALL integration passes:** Do NOT introduce new citations. Only rearrange, rephrase, or strengthen references to papers already cited in the sections.

#### 6a. Transition Pass
Rewrite boundary paragraphs between consecutive sections for natural flow. Ending of Section N should create expectation that Section N+1 answers.

#### 6b. Cross-Reference Resolution
Verify every scaffold cross-reference exists in text. Add missing ones. Ensure references are specific ("As discussed in Section 3, the laminar distribution...") not vague ("As mentioned earlier...").

#### 6c. Terminology and Voice
Consistent terminology throughout. Fix terms used differently across sections. Abbreviations defined on first use. Smooth voice inconsistencies.

#### 6d. Argument Continuity Audit
Does the argument build as scaffold intended? Where does the logical chain break? Does conclusion follow from what sections actually contain?

#### 6e. Figure Consistency
Consistent color palette, fonts, line weights across all figures. No duplicate labels. All \ref{} resolve. Caption depth consistent.
- **File existence audit:** Verify every `\includegraphics{}` path corresponds to an actual figure file produced during Phase 7. Report any mismatches as a `filename_mismatches` list in the integration log.

#### 6f. Structural Hygiene
```
□ Zero \begin{thebibliography} blocks
□ Zero \documentclass in section files  
□ Zero \bibitem entries in section files
□ All \citep{}/\citet{} keys collected into master list
□ Consistent \citep{AuthorYear}/\citet{AuthorYear} format
□ No duplicate \label{} definitions
□ All \ref{} resolve to existing \label{}
```


**Output requirement:** The integration agent MUST save UPDATED versions of each section .md 
and .tex file. The coordinator verifies: diff between pre- and post-integration files must show 
changes in at least the transition paragraphs (first/last paragraphs of each section).
If the agent reports "6 passes completed" but the files are unchanged → send back.

**GATE ARTIFACT:** After all 6 passes complete, save `gate_integration.json`:

```python
gate_data = {
    'passes_completed': ['6a_transition', '6b_crossref', '6c_terminology',
                         '6d_continuity', '6e_figures', '6f_hygiene'],
    'filename_mismatches': [...],  # from 6e
    'structural_issues': [...],    # from 6f
}
json.dump(gate_data, open('gate_integration.json', 'w'), indent=2)
advance_phase('6_integration', '<saved_version_id>')
```


## Phase 11: Introduction and Conclusion

**Agent:** EXPERT_CRITICAL_LITERATURE_REVIE

**MANDATORY:** Written AFTER all body sections are complete and integrated. Writing them first commits to conclusions before evidence is reviewed.

**PREREQUISITE:**
```python
require_phase('6_integration')
check_gate('gate_integration.json')
```

**Citation discipline:** Introduction and conclusion may ONLY cite papers already cited in the body sections. The master citation list from Phase 10f must be provided to the writer. Do not introduce new references.

- **Introduction:** Receives 1-paragraph summaries of all sections + central argument + master citation list. Frames problem, explains why review is needed, previews argument arc naturally.
- **Conclusion:** Receives section summaries + key findings including conflicts and gaps + master citation list. Synthesizes (not summarizes), acknowledges limitations, identifies open questions.


**MANDATORY — Abstract:**
Phase 11 also writes a 200-300 word Abstract for insertion into `content/00_frontmatter.md`. The Abstract must:
- Cite the UNIQUE paper count from `citation_key_map` (not the pre-dedup count from evidence compliance)
- Summarize the central thesis, key findings, and methodology
- Save as a separate artifact `abstract.md` for Phase 13 to insert into the frontmatter
